# LxN_Greenhouse
Repository for data and code used for a light-by-nitrogen greenhouse experiment conducted in the [http://www.smithecophyslab.com/](Smith Ecophys Lab) at Texas Tech University. This experiment is being used to write two manuscripts. The first manuscript (Perkowski et al., in prep) focuses on variance in plant carbon costs to acquire nitrogen due to light availability, nitrogen availability, and nitrogen acquisition strategy. The second manuscript (Waring & Smith, in prep) focuses on the relative role of soil nitrogen availability and environmental conditions on leaf- and whole plant photosynthetic traits.

Currently, this repository contains data relevant to the Perkowski et al. (in prep) manuscript. Data and the associated metadata .csv files can be located in the `data_sheets` folder. This data sheet does not include the metrics used in the Perkowski et al. (in prep) manuscript; however, calculations for these metrics can be found in the `R_files` folder in the file named `create_ndemand_metrics.R`. The data frame created from `create_ndemand_metrics.R` is directly loaded into the data analysis R file, which can be accessed in the same `R_files` as `ndemand_analyses.R`

NOTE: This repository will be updated with data and metadata from Waring & Smith (in prep) and will be released as a second version on Zenodo.
